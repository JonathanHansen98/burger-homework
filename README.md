# Eat Da Burger

https://eat-das-burger.herokuapp.com/

My first FULL stack application, baby! This is served using handlebars and express, and allows users to interact with a MySQl database. Users can add burgers, then click the devour button to move them to the 'devoured burgers' section. Users can then delete the burger from the database, removing them from the page.
